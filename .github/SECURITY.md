# Security Policy

## Versions

### Latest Versions

We advise users to run or update to the most recent release of the Ansible NGINX role. Older versions of this role may not have all enhancements and/or bug fixes applied to them.

### Supported Versions

This codebase mainly consists of an Ansible role, sprinkled with a dose of GitHub actions for CI/CD. Ansible applies security fixes to the most recent three releases. Please find more information in [the Ansible docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html#release-status).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability that affects Ansible directly, we encourage you to report it according to the [Ansible guidelines](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/reporting_bugs_and_features.html#reporting-a-bug).
